# Hotel Booking Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the Hotel Booking Analysis project, focusing on understanding booking cancellations and proposing strategies to mitigate them. The project involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of hotel booking data, aiming to uncover insights that can help improve revenue streams and customer satisfaction.

## Business Questions Explored

1. What is the distribution of canceled vs. non-canceled bookings?
2. How does lead time affect booking cancellations?
3. Are there any trends in booking cancellations over time?
4. Which months have the highest number of booking cancellations?
5. What is the impact of booking channel on cancellation rates?
6. How do different customer segments contribute to booking cancellations?
7. Is there a correlation between booking changes and cancellation rates?
8. How do special requests influence booking cancellations?
9. What are the common characteristics of canceled bookings?
10. Are there any geographical factors affecting cancellation rates?
11. ...

(Include all 22 business questions explored)

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the `hotel_booking.csv` dataset, which includes the following columns:

- `hotel`
- `is_canceled`
- `lead_time`
- `arrival_date_year`
- ...

(Include all column names)

## Project Summary

This Hotel Booking Analysis EDA project delves into the intricate world of booking cancellations and the underlying patterns. Its ultimate aim is to propose actionable measures that can help mitigate cancellations and secure revenue streams.

The dataset encompasses booking information for both a city hotel and a resort hotel, including details like booking timestamps, length of stays, and guest demographics. The project involves an exploration of fundamental EDA concepts and data visualization techniques.

In the course of this project, I will conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on the provided dataset, uncovering valuable insights and offering practical strategies to curb cancellations and bolster revenue. For instance, suggested strategies include incentivizing early bookings, extended stays through discounts, and enhancing the booking experience for direct reservations.

The EDA journey unfolds through three phases: data exploration, data preprocessing, and three distinct analytical approaches: Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, and Multivariate Analysis. These methods enable us to decipher trends, correlations, and patterns that reveal valuable insights.

In conclusion, this Hotel Booking Analysis EDA project underscores the pivotal role of data analysis in the hospitality industry. By meticulously examining hotel booking data and unraveling cancellation patterns, hotels can implement strategic measures to mitigate cancellations and enhance revenue streams.
